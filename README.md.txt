# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my Lab 1 project for Web Development I.  
It is a simple one-page portfolio website built using only semantic HTML tags.

## Features
- About section with profile picture
- Projects section (list of 2–3 projects)
- Skills section (table format)
- Contact form (Name, Email, Message) with labels, placeholders, and required attributes
- Internal navigation and accessibility link ("Skip to main content")
